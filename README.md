# Project Overview

Robotic process automation (RPA) is a software technology that makes it easy to build, deploy, and manage software robots that emulate humans actions interacting with digital systems and software. RPA robots can perform tasks such as understand the content of a screen, complete the correct keystrokes, navigate systems, identify and extract data, and perform a wide range of defined actions.

This project automates testing of a deploye web app. When the process is run, the first automation process clicks on login to open the login page.
The robot populates the username and password, clicks on remember me and logs in.
On the home page a click event navigates to Customer, a click event navigates to Create New CUSTOMER, a new window opens and the different inputs are automatically populated and a new CUSTOMER is created.
A click event navigates to edit and edits the cellphone number textbox and save.
The next sequence is delete where delete link is clicked and the selected data is deleted on a delete click button.
This process repeats for all the Navigation links through Robotic Peocessing Automation with UiPath Studio
