# Project Overview

Robotic process automation (RPA) is a software technology that makes it easy to build, deploy, and manage software robots that emulate humans actions interacting with digital systems and software. RPA robots can perform tasks such as understand the content of a screen, complete the correct keystrokes, navigate systems, identify and extract data, and perform a wide range of defined actions.
